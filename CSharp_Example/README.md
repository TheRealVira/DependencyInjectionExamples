## Short summary
This example explains how to use dependency injections **local** and **online**!

## Task
The customer wants a software solution, which allows the following things:
* An documented generic interface to print text onto the console.
* A way to change the method of printing, **without** recompiling the program.
* A method to load the configuration file (which holds the selection of how the customer wants to print text onto the console) online and ofline/local online.
* That configuration file has to be handled using _``*.xml``_ format.

## How to use it
This project is based on the **``IConsoleOutputable``**, which holds a ``Print(string)`` method. To use it, simple implement it:

````
internal class Example : IConsoleOutputable
{
    public void Print(string text)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"-={text}=-");
    }
}
````

You can than let it get generated by the ``OutputableFactory``:

````
OutputableFactory.Factorise<Example>().Print("This is some other text");
````

For a generic version of it, which is also used for the config file, you could use the default ``GenericPrinter``, which holds a variable inner type:

````
OutputableFactory.Factorise<GenericPrinter<Example1>>().Save("example.xml");
````

Loading an ``IConsoleOutputable`` is also an easy task:

````
OutputableFactory.Load("example.xml").Print("This is text!");
````

## Config file
The config file (a saved ``GenericPrinter``) could look like the followed example:

````
<GenericPrinter x:TypeArguments="pb:Example2" xmlns="clr-namespace:Printer;assembly=Printer" xmlns:pb="clr-namespace:Printer.Buildin_Examples;assembly=Printer" xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml" />
````

The ``x:TypeArguments=`` is than defining which ``IConsoleOutputable`` is used as printing method. This allows the customer to change the configuration **without** recompiling the program!
